## 📋 Checklist Before Sharing

Before sharing any technical information, ask yourself:

- [ ] Would this help a competitor replicate our solution?
- [ ] Does this expose our infrastructure to security risks?
- [ ] Have we received permission to share customer names?
- [ ] Are we sharing implementation details or just capabilities?
- [ ] Would this information be valuable to attackers?

## 🚨 Red Flags in Investor Questions

Be cautious if asked for:
- Detailed database schemas
- Specific security implementations
- Complete customer list with revenue
- Source code access before term sheet
- Detailed cost breakdowns
- Employee personal information

These may be legitimate due diligence requests but should be handled through proper channels with NDAs in place.

## 📞 Escalation Path

If unsure about what to share:
1. Default to being vague rather than specific
2. Offer to schedule a follow-up with more details
3. Consult with leadership before sharing
4. Document what was shared and to whom
