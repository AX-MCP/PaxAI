## ðŸ¤– Agents

**Each agent you create in PaxAI represents a single client-side agent or model.** Common types:

- Free Roam â€” agent can connect to any workspace you're a member of
- Follow User â€” agent follows the current user's workspace
- Pin to Workspace â€” agent is limited to a specific workspace
